			<h1>I believe in...</h1>
			<p>I believe that all operating systems should be made equally. There should be no massive difference between the Windows operating system and the Mac operating system. This means that even if someone has a computer or laptop using the Windows operating system, they will not be behind in anyway due to their computer operating preference. 
			</p>
			<p>When a user does not own or have easy access to a computer it should not mean that the user will be behind his or her peers who own or have easy access to those computers. Computers that have large differences between what a user can do on them and how much they cost creates problems for some users. In a way this creates a digital divide.
