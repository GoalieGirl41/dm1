			<p>When a person shops for a computer, they should not have to worry about what they can or cannot get on the computer they get. All computer programs should be able to work on all computers no matter what the OS is. When computers have major program/application differences, it creates a form of digital divide from which people have to purchase a different computer as their only way to escape.
